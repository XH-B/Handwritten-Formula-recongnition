2.This repository contains the source code for WAP introduced in the following papers:

VGG: Watch, attend and parse: An end-to-end neural network based approach to handwritten mathematical expression recognition
DenseNet: Multi-Scale Attention with Dense Encoder for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition
Here, VGG contains the code that employs VGG architecture as the watcher, DenseNet contains the code that employs DenseNet as the watcher.
